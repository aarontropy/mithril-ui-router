Mithril UI Router [![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)
=================

Mithril UI router is a routing framework for MithrilJS, which allows you to organize your interface into a state machine in the close way than [AngularUI Router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) does for AngularJS. So, unlike the `m.route` service in the which is organized around URL routes, Mithril UI router is organized around states, which may optionally have routes.
